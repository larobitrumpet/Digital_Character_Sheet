# Digital Character Sheet
This is a project I created for my Technology Innovation class. It is a web application that helps you create a Dungeons and Dragons 5th Edition character. It's goal is to help speed up the character creation process and to make that process easier for new player's to understand. Currently it is more of a proof of concept as there are many things that currently don't work correctly and there are some major features missing.  

DUNGEONS & DRAGONS, D&D, Wizards of the Coast, Forgotten Realms, the dragon ampersand, *Player's Handbook*, *Monster Manual*, *Dungeon Master's Guide*, *Xanathar's Guide to Everything*, all other Wizards of the Coast product names, and their respective logos are trademarks of Wizards of the Coast in the USA and other countries.
